**What This Video Covers**: Periodix Planner turns Obsidian into a time-aware planning system that helps you reason about where your time goes, not just what you get done.

**Core Concepts**:
- **Automatic Periodic Note Generation** - Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly notes (always one step ahead)
- **Hierarchical Linking** - Notes connected through frontmatter metadata creating a navigable time structure
- **Time Investment Model** - Allocate time into categories (work, learning, health, relationships, projects), not tasks
- **Budget Flow** - Time budgets cascade from year → quarter → month → week → day
- **Visual Feedback** - See remaining, exhausted, or over-allocated time at a glance
- **Complementary to Task Managers** - Focus on deciding what deserves your time, not just execution

**Philosophy**: This plugin treats time like a finite investment portfolio. You cannot do everything. Periodix Planner forces prioritization by making trade-offs visible. Tasks are result-oriented; Periodix Planner is time-oriented.
